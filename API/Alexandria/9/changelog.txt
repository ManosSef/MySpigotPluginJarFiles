BUILD 9

Additions
- TabCompletions#none(): returns TabCompletions.NONE
- TabCompletions#completers(TabCompleter...): returns a tab completer that, for the index of the argument being tab completed, tab completes the arguments that the tab completer at that index of the given array would tab complete
	- Like #arguments(TabCompleter...) but it passes the entire args array to the chosen tab completer instead of just the last string
