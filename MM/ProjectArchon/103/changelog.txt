BUILD 103

Changes
- The plugin now depends on Alexandria
- The "current-border-size" option is now saved to and read from a new file called data.yml instead of config.yml
	- If the value is not set in data.yml but is set in config.yml then it is still read from config.yml for backward compatibility
