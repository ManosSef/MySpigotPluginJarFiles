BUILD 115 (2.7.0)

SINCE LAST STABLE RELEASE (2.6.1)

Additions
- Added config option "lifesteal.enabled"
	- If true, players with "lifesteal.max-lives-to-steal" or fewer lives gain 1 life if they kill a player with "lifesteal.min-lives-to-be-robbed" or more lives
	- Defaults to false
- Added config option "lifesteal.max-lives-to-steal"
	- Controls the highest life count a player can have while still being able to steal lives by killing players
	- Defaults to 2
	- Cannot be set to a value above "lives-limit", unless that value is 0
- Added config option "lifesteal.min-lives-to-be-robbed"
	- Controls the lowest life count a player can have while still being able to be robbed of lives by being killed by other players
	- Defaults to 4
	- Cannot be set to a value above "lives-limit", unless that value is 0
- Added messages "lives-message-after-lifesteal.plural", "lives-message-after-lifesteal.singular" and "lives-message-after-lifesteal.none", which appear when a player steals a life by killing a player
- API additions:
	- LifeChanges#addLifeUpToLimit(Player): runs #addLife(Player) and then #respectLivesLimit(Player)
	- LifeChanges#setLivesUpToLimit(Player, int): runs #setLives(Player, int) and then #respectLivesLimit(Player)
	- LifeChanges#livesMessageAfterLifesteal(Player, Player): shows the lifesteal-related messages mentioned above
	- Added fields livesAfterLifestealPlural, livesAfterLifestealSingular and livesAfterLifestealNone to Messages

Changes
- Due to internal setup changes, the plugin no longer supports Minecraft versions below 1.17
	- Even though 1.17(.1) can be run with Java 16, the plugin only supports Java 17 or above
- Config option "lives-limit" can now be set to 0, which makes the plugin operate as if there was no limit
- Removed the deadPlayers.yml file. Players are now considered dead if their life count is equal to zero
- API changes:
	- SemiHardcore#getDeadPlayersFile is now terminally deprecated
	- LifeChanges#setDead now does nothing and is deprecated
	- LifeChanges#setLives and LifeChanges#addLife can no longer set a player's life count above the life limit
	- LifeChanges#setLivesUpToLimit, LifeChanges#addLifeUpToLimit and LifeChanges#respectLivesLimit are now deprecated
	- Options is now a record, therefore there are new accessor methods, named exactly after each field
		- The old accessor methods are now deprecated and kept for backwards compatibility

Fixes
- SH-7 - The first sentence of the update checker's message is missing a period
- SH-8 - The message for the starting lives or life limit being 1 is not sent by the plugin's logger
- SH-10 - Using /setlives to set a player's lives to zero does not produce a success message
- SH-11 - Using /setlives to set a player's lives to zero calls PlayerLifeChangeEvent twice
- SH-12 - Using /setlives to set a player's lives to a number above the life limit calls PlayerLifeChangeEvent twice
- SH-13 - Setting a player's life count to its current value calls PlayerLifeChangeEvent

SINCE LAST BUILD (114)

Changes
- Removed the message shown when config option "hardcore-hearts" is enabled in a Minecraft version below 1.15, as such versions are no longer supported
