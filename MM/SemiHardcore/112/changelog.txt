BUILD 112

Changes
- Due to internal setup changes, the plugin no longer supports Minecraft versions below 1.17
	- Even though 1.17(.1) can be run with Java 16, the plugin only supports Java 17 or above
- Config option "lives-limit" can now be set to 0, which makes the plugin operate as if there was no limit
- Removed the deadPlayers.yml file. Players are now considered dead if their life count is equal to zero
- API changes:
	- SemiHardcore#getDeadPlayersFile is now terminally deprecated
	- LifeChanges#setDead now does nothing and is deprecated
	- LifeChanges#setLives and LifeChanges#addLife can no longer set a player's life count above the life limit
	- LifeChanges#setLivesUpToLimit, LifeChanges#addLifeUpToLimit and LifeChanges#respectLivesLimit are now deprecated
	- Options is now a record, therefore there are new accessor methods, named exactly after each field
		- The old accessor methods are now deprecated and kept for backwards compatibility

Fixes
- SH-7 - The first sentence of the update checker's message is missing a period
- SH-8 - The message for the starting lives or life limit being 1 is not sent by the plugin's logger
- SH-10 - Using /setlives to set a player's lives to zero does not produce a success message
- SH-11 - Using /setlives to set a player's lives to zero calls PlayerLifeChangeEvent twice
- SH-12 - Using /setlives to set a player's lives to a number above the life limit calls PlayerLifeChangeEvent twice
- SH-13 - Setting a player's life count to its current value calls PlayerLifeChangeEvent
