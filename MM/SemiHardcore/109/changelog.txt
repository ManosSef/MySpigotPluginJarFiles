BUILD 109 (2.6.1)

SINCE LAST STABLE RELEASE (2.6.0)

Changes
- The plugin no longer requires the "hardcore" option in server.properties to be disabled

Fixes
- SH-3 - The sentence for players sacrificing themselves in the settings printed to the console when the plugin is enabled is grammatically incorrect
- SH-5 - The javadoc for SemiHardcore#getOfficialAddonList is missing a period
- SH-6 - Respawning with hardcore hearts enabled makes the player a spectator even if they have lives left
