BUILD 100

Changes
- Due to internal setup changes, the plugin no longer supports Minecraft versions below 1.18

Fixes
- WM-1 - Entities disappear when using portals in custom worlds
- WM-2 - Coordinates are multiplied by 8 instead of divided when using a portal to teleport from a custom End to its associated Nether
- WM-3 - The warning message sent when the world a player is in is about to be deleted is grammatically incorrect
- WM-4 - The /deleteworld command assumes the main world is always called "world"
- WM-5 - Entering an end portal in a custom world places the entity 1 block too high in the End
