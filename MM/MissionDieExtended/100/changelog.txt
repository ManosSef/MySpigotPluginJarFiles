Changes
- Minecraft versions before 1.21 are no longer supported
- The plugin now tries to fit any death by entities into a possible death task created by following common patterns, instead of checking a lot of specific entities one by one
	- A message is printed to the console if a death task that could be given does not exist, so that missing cases that would warrant death tasks can be noticed
- The book shown when running the /mytasks command is now dynamically generated instead of every line being hardcoded
	- Tasks added in 1.19 or later are no longer collected on the last page
- The tasks in the book shown when running /mytasks have been reordered
- The tasks SKELETON_ATTACK and STRAY_ATTACK have been removed as they are no longer possible to complete in survival without commands
