BUILD 101

Changes
- Due to internal setup changes, the plugin no longer supports Minecraft versions below 1.17
	- Even though 1.17(.1) can be run with Java 16, the plugin only supports Java 17 or above
- The plugin now checks if the OPLootBase plugin that exists on the server is the correct one

Fixes
- OTHER-48 - Dropping an apple from a stack of more than 1 spawns OP loot without consuming the apple
- OTHER-49 - Dropping an entire stack of more than 1 apple at once only spawns one round of OP loot
