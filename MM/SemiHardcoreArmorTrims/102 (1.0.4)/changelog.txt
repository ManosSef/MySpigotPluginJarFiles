BUILD 102 (1.0.4)

SINCE LAST STABLE RELEASE (1.0.3)

Additions
- Added a new message: trim-unchanged
	- Appears when the player tries to change their armor trim to the one they currently have using /changetrim
	- Set to "&cNothing changed; the specified armor trim is your current one." by default

Fixes
- OTHER-17 - The initial armor trim selection menu sometimes appears again after selecting a trim
- OTHER-150 - /changetrim succeeds even when the trim doesn't change
- OTHER-157 - The plugin thinks the newest versions are unsupported
