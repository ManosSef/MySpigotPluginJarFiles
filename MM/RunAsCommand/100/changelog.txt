BUILD 100

Changes
- Due to internal setup changes, the plugin no longer supports Minecraft versions below 1.17
	- Even though 1.17(.1) can be run with Java 16, the plugin only supports Java 17 or above
- The first argument of /runas now also supports specifying player names directly instead of needing to use players' UUIDs

Fixes
- OTHER-65 - All arguments of /runas except the first two tab complete player names
