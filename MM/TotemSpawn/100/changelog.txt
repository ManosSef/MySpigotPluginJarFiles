BUILD 100

Changes
- Due to internal setup changes, the plugin no longer supports Minecraft versions below 1.17
	- Even though 1.17(.1) can be run with Java 16, the plugin only supports Java 17 or above

Fixes
- OTHER-71 - Loading the plugin while the server is already running doesn't give every existing mob totems
- OTHER-72 - Loading the plugin while players are online replaces the items in their selected hotbar slot and off hand with totems
- OTHER-73 - The plugin can give totems to players who have been given totems before
