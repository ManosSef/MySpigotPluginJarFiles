Fixes
- OTHER-222 - The titles shown when rolling tasks flash for a brief moment
- OTHER-223 - The success message of /rolltasks is missing a period when only one player is getting a task
- OTHER-225 - Books given by the plugin have no data other than the persistent task ID
- OTHER-226 - Succeeding or failing tasks that edit health shows a "+0.0 heart" title when the health doesn't change
- OTHER-227 - Titles shown when health is modified are extremely accurate
- OTHER-228 - Succeeding a task while on 1 life gives extra hearts that can overflow 30
- OTHER-229 - Succeeding a task while on more than 1 life and 30 or more hearts removes hearts
