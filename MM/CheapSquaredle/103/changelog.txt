Additions
- Added a puzzle solver class
	- Currently not used for anything

Changes
- Hints can now be disabled again after being enabled
- The command for enabling hints has been changed to "/squaredle hints", and now disables hints if used while hints are enabled
- The puzzle output in chat now includes clickable text for enabling/disabling hints if the minimum score for hints has been reached
- The plugin no longer supports Minecraft versions before 1.17
- The plugin now requires the commons-collections4 library (version 4.4)
	- The server should download it automatically

Fixes
- CS-1 - "Exit puzzle" and "Show stats for this puzzle" in chat puzzle output don't do anything when clicked
- Fixed two words in the banned guesses list that had a space and thus weren't considered banned guesses
