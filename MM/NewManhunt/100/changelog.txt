BUILD 100

Changes
- Due to internal setup changes, the plugin no longer supports Minecraft versions below 1.17
	- Even though 1.17(.1) can be run with Java 16, the plugin only supports Java 17 or above
- Compasses given by the /newhunter command now have a persistent value and custom lore to distinguish them from other compasses
	- Using compasses without that persistent value no longer causes them to point to the nearest non-hunter
- Added a proper description and usage strings to /newhunter
- The error messages of /newhunter are now more descriptive

Fixes
- OTHER-39 - All arguments of /newhunter tab complete player names
- OTHER-40 - The /newhunter command can add and remove hunters more than once
- OTHER-41 - The /newhunter command cannot give a player a compass if their inventory is full
- OTHER-42 - The /newhunter command cannot remove compasses from a player's inventory if they are in a stack of more than 1
