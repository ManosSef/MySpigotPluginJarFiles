BUILD 101

Additions
- Added the config.yml option "enabled"
	- When false, no spawn reason messages are sent
	- The default value is true

Changes
- The plugin now depends on Alexandria, with target version 1.0.0-build11
- The values of config.yml options are now validated when the plugin is enabled (OTHER-243)
	- If any value is of the wrong type for its option, the plugin disables itself
- Running /spawnreasonlogger with no arguments now toggles the config.yml option "enabled"
- Spawn reason message colors are now also different based on the entity type (OTHER-244)
- Made the failure message shown when running /spawnreasonlogger with an invalid first argument more descriptive

Fixes
- Running /spawnreasonlogger with only one argument now shows the invalid argument message if that argument is invalid
